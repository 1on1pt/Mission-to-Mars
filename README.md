# Mission-to-Mars
Web scraping online data to create a web application using Flask, Python, and MongoDB.

## Overview of the Project
Robin has a goal to one day work for NASA.  She has a huge interest in Mars and has decided to develop a web page that she called **Mission to Mars** that would *scrape* data and images from various websites.  In the process she would:

  * Use Chrome Developer Tools to identify HTML components
  * Use BeautifulSoup and Splinter to automate the scrape
  * Use MongoDB to store the data
  * Use Flask to display the data

Robin would design her webpage to include the following information:

  * Latest Mars News
  * Feature Mars Image
  * Mars Facts
  * Mars Hemispheres

Robin built into her web page the ability to click the **Scrape New Data** button.  Once clicked, this allowed the scraping script to reconnect with the various websites, update the database, and display any new data and/or images.

Finally, she polished the website by using various Bootstrap components.

## Deliverable 1:  Scrape Full-Resolution Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles
The goal of this deliverable was to use BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Mars’s hemispheres and the titles of those images and store in a dictionary.  In order to achieve this deliverable, the following steps were taken:
 * Code is written that retrieves the full-resolution image and title for each hemisphere image
 * The full-resolution images of the hemispheres are added to the dictionary
 * The titles for the hemisphere images are added to the dictionary
 * The list contains the dictionary of the full-resolution image URL string and title for each hemisphere image

Here is the original code and output:

## Deliverable 2:  Update the Web App with Mars’s Hemisphere Images and Titles



## Deliverable 3:  Add Bootstrap 3 Components
