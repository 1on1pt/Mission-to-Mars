# Mission-to-Mars
Web scraping online data to create a web application using Flask, Python, and MongoDB.

## Overview of the Project
Robin has a goal to one day work for NASA.  She has a huge interest in Mars and has decided to develop a web page that she called **Mission to Mars** that would *scrape* data and images from various websites.  In the process she would:

  * Use Chrome Developer Tools to identify HTML components
  * Use BeautifulSoup and Splinter to automate the scrape
  * Use MongoDB to store the data
  * Use Flask to display the data

Robin would design her webpage to include the following information:

  * Latest Mars News
  * Feature Mars Image
  * Mars Facts
  * Mars Hemispheres

Robin built into her web page the ability to click the **Scrape New Data** button.  Once clicked, this allowed the scraping script to reconnect with the various websites, update the database, and display any new data and/or images.

Finally, she polished the website by using various Bootstrap components.
